# Easy-Easing-for-SCSS

A partial for SCSS to make easing easy! Just @include (or @use) this partial and call it into your timing functions e.g.

animation-timing-function: get-easing("easeInSine");

Standard easeIn and easeOut functions were sourced from Mozilla.org and advanced cubic-bezier values are courtesy of easings.net.
